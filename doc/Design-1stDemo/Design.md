# Overview

A story/atmosphere driven adventure game. The player controls the central character who moves through a series of connected areas and can interact with people and entities. Dialogue choices, other interactions, and simple objectives reveal more about the world and the player. The final ending will depend on the actions and dialogue choices of the player.

Essentially a simple demo that can be played in a few hours. Something that can be completed in a few months of spare-time work.

# Goals

The goal is to create a short and simple game--something that can be completed in my free time and drive development of an engine.

Thus the focus will be on simple mechanics and rely on being story drive.

# Inspiration
A collection of things, original and referenced, to serve as inspiration for style, mechanics, story, etc.

## *The Hunt Begins* -- Introductory Exposition (Original composition)

The silence is broken by the snap of a log and subsequent crackle of the newly invigorated fire. The small disturbance causes a cricket to begin chirping, and the effect ripples as the forest is a cacophony of creatures stirring. The ever present sound of life that goes unnoticed and unfiltered.

A lone figure occupies a log close by the fire, but his skyward gaze appears to be unperturbed by the sudden protest of the fire. After a long moment passes, he begins to stir, then roughly grabs a nearby stick and pokes the fire, corralling it back into a concise pile. All without breaking his upward gaze through cold motionless eyes.

The fire intensifies as a breeze blows through, causing the figure to lazily bundle himself with his cloak, causing fur to shift and ripple and drag underneath it.

The intensified fire illuminates fierce eyes nestled deep back upon his extended tongue, and the broken antlers protruding from his ears. The fire begins to calm as after it gluttonous consumption of air and fuel. Silence returns to the forest.

A sudden twitch of the figure's head precedes a soft distant howl. He vigorously stands and waits. Another howl answers the first, sounding much closer. He eagerly extinguishes the fire and adjusts his cloak to his new position.

He removes the hood of his cloak to reveal the wolf pelt tightly encompassing his strong cervid physique.

"The hunt begins"

## Mechanics/style

*See No Evil*, a adult bara erotic adventure game. Mechanically very straightforward. Character can move left/right along a room, and into other rooms by going off-screen, or entering a door with "up". The character can also interact with entities by pressing "up", or by typing in commands. Items can be collected to advance the story and objectives completed. The ending changes depending on how much of the dialogue tree the player has explored and the objectives completed.
