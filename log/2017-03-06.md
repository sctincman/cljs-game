# Things I Did
* Contemplated AABB collision detection
	* Got as far as sketches and stubs
    * Need more time/awakeness and forthought
* Attempted to implement a "follow" AI behavior
	* Decided *behavior* is a better term than *ai*
    * Needed a way to reference another entity
    	* Did **NOT** want to do more filters/finds!
        * ...but what about hash lookups? (see dicussion below)
* Converted the world from *vector of entities* to *map of entities*, using their "id" as a key.
	* used `reduce-kv`, which gives the added benefit of having access to the in-progress entities in the reduce function
    * Need to investigate
* Used this to implement `follow` as `(follow [entity target offset)` which I *REALLY* like/grok.
* Swapped out the `input` component for this `ai/follow` component and IT WORKED!
	* This feels really good

# Map of Entities versus Vector of Entities
I don't know why I didn't pick this up from [Chocaltier](https://github.com/alexkehayias/chocolatier) and the corresponding talk.

Instead of a vector we need to iterate and map to find a single entity, we can use a map with an identifier as the key. As Clojure uses HashMaps above a certain size, this has the beneits of O(1) lookup.

Iterating hasn't been a problem now with the isolated entities, but is starting to now that they can reference each other, or we need to get certain utility entities we should just be able to reference directly.

## Collision Detection
I have been dreading this as well. I know from my experience with [Chipmunk](https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk2D) (this is still active!!!) that a spatial hash-map is a great optimization for rapidly culling the number of pairs of objects to test for collision, however I've been struggling on a way to do this in my ECS/FRP/functional paradigm.

But! Now that I have entities in a hash by their ID, I can make a new component, `space` or something, that holds a spatial hashmap, where each bin holds the keys of the entities in that region.

The `collision` (or a separate `spatial`), will be responsible for updating this component state, grabbing the `:position` and `:bounding` components of entities and computing their binning, storing their keys in each bin.

When permutating pairs, the `collision` system will grab the keys from each bin (O(1)), lookup those entities (O(1)), then call each pair (O(n^2)).
