# Things I Did
## 2017-04-09
* Fleshed out the preliminary collision handling stubs
    * Broken and froze game...
## 2017-04-17
* Finally began debugging the collision handling.
* Made good progress in:
    * Bucketing positions, and AABBs
    * Populating spatial hash buckets
    * Collision pairs
## 2017-04-18
* Debugged collision pairs
* Debugged signal based collision handling (YAY)

# Collision Handling Thoughts
I still need to implement the thought I had last time for preventing duplicates. I currently iterate the cells, but I need to iterate the entities, and test their cells.

I currently implemented the handling as a signal based. When a collision occurs, the system looks for a `:collisions` component, and `s/propagates` the collision pair to the atom. This works great in testing, but it also spams the `s/watch` rapidly and causes slowdowns.

I need to debounce this somehow. I'm also unsure if signals would be the best approach now.

## Debouncing
Implement a buffered signal, collect all collision pairs from that iteration in a set, find the relative difference, send un-collide events to those, collide events to the news pairs, and keep the intersection. This should be easy enough with Clojure sets, but hopefully not too slow.
