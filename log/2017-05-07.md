# Things I Did Today
* Implemented sprite mirroring
* Tested with state-animation

# Mirroring
I implemented this by taking advantage of WebGL/Three.js and `MirroredRepeatTexture`: instead of managing flags and booleans and checking all things, just have the `subtexture` procedure check if a negative offset is used, and enable `MirroredRepeatTexture` on the texture.

The `sprite-sheet` method was changed to permute from 0->n to -n->n. This way the mirrored version of a sprite can be accessed by using `0-n` index on the respective access.

The `0-n` does put some strain on end-users for the sake of simiplicity under the hood, but a more friendly wrapper can be placed around this.

# Problems
I realize I don't have a good way to deal with previous state, especially in animations. The problem essentially is my movement FSM looks like this

Moving-right -(left)-> Moving-left
Moving-right -(release)-> standing
Moving-left -(right)-> Moving-right
Moving-left -(release)-> standing
Standing -(left)-> Moving-left
Standing -(right)-> Moving-left

And the problem I encountered was, "when the character is moving left and stops, how do I know to draw the left-facing stand animation?"

The kludge would be to make a second stand state, and make them both directional, but this would make the graph complicated.

It would be great to access `previous-state` when determining an animation, and it'd be better to make the previous state optional.

# Thoughts
Transducers would fit very well into my signal work. It would make composition much cleaner, and allow use of any transduction procedures (assuming I can write good wrappers). It should also make my code better performing, with much less intermediate values and function calls used by my atom/watcher approach.
