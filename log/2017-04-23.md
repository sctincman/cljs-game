# Things I Did Today
* Solved async texture loading problem
    * Load textures at start, have `js-start-game!` called once all the textures have been loaded, and pass backend and resources
* Debugged and fixed problems with subtextures and texture atlases
    * Ugh! This was so annoying
    * Hard to drill into ThreeJS structures from Clojurescript
* Implemented scaling for sprites
* Demo'd parallax layered backgrounds

# Problems
Animation should be easy, have an animation timer signal that moves through a frame-sequence, every frame, have the system call a handler function (in this case `key-texture`) with the value of the animation signal.

However, I'm still unsure about tiling... Rendering to texture requires me to setup the scene--it'd be just as much work to make a custom tiling shader.
