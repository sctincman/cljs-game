# Things I Did Today
* Moved logs from tiddlywiki to this repo
    * Tiddlywiki was getting annoying to use, and I didn't have access from anywhere else.
        * - Editor is annoying to use
        * + Enjoy the non-linear linking ability
            * Author individual `md` documents, link someother way
    * Revision controlled as well!
    * Other editors have md preview which I find very helpful
* Created a design document for the initial demo
    * Need to establish a documentation/logging workflow
    * Possibly log engine and low-level details in `log/{date}.md`
    * Possibly log design details in `log/{project name}/{date}.md`
        * See [this post](http://www.lostgarden.com/2011/05/game-design-logs.html) for my inspiration
        * I really grok the "outline and evolve" approach
