# Thigns I Did Today
* Grabbed assets from open game art that fit my idea
* Determined a good split-complimentary color scheme (Hues 240, 90, and 30)
    * Recolored assets with them
    * Made a quick scene mockup.
* Prototyped how to do a texture atlas in order to enable sprite sheets and animations

# Actually constructing scenes

There are two things I need here: tiling assets, and animating sprites.

Both rely on indexing subsets of images. I'm familiar with sprite sheets, and needed a way to implement this with textures in Three.js. Luckily Three.js supports wrapping, repeating, and offsets for textures, and I was able to quickly mock a texture atlas this way by setting wrapping to repeat, and `repeat` to `1/frame-width`. By setting the `offset` of a texture to `(frame-width/texture-width)*n`.

Animation changes the offset with time. Tiling sets the offset from a map.

For animation, make a dataformat that indicates a frame and duration. Frame is the index of the sprite, duration is how long. Have behavior subsystem set what animation is playing. We need to update which frame is currently displaying. I think I will initially have it be a reduction over a tick signal. I'd like to enable different duration for a frame instead of a constant frame rate, but the former will be easier to implement quickly.

What I need to do is implement a way to reference a texture that has already been loaded, and share this among objects.

For tiling, do I make a sprite per tile? Or, should I make a custom plane with UV coordinates?

Super lazy: one giant sprite with repeat set.

# Parallax

How do I enable parallax? Have offset scaled by layer, and affected by camera position.

Something like `offset = camera.x/distance`

# Interacting
Have collision transition to a `posture`, input in this state queries the collision pairs, which can trigger events/dialogue
