I attempted to start implementing an ECS system. The short-term goal was to get a controllable entity on screen, generated programmatically. The mid-term goal was to get multiple entities on screen.

I added protocols and records for a base `Entity` and `Component` records. The former only stores an `id` and a `components` map.

I originally was going to add a vector of components, but did not want to iterate. I noticed objects can have more fields added to the map while still retaining `instance?` identity of the original record. I tried implementing this, but was running into errors. As it turns out this was unrelated: `(vec ARecord)` seems to vectorize the record? I'll need to confirm.

I switched this to be a Map of components. This has the upside of making the entities uniform, but having quick access of individual components.

I implemented registration by just having a single vector of entities. Systems can filter based on needs, for example `renderable?` checks if the components map has a `:render-component` and `:position-component` (doesn't do type checking, but we have that capability), then filters them using that predicate.

This may not be "performant" (filtering a large list every frame), but I've been trying to imagine a nice clojure way to implement "find all entities with these components" and filter is just the obvious answer. I've read about others who have entities registered in system specific lists upon adding the requisite components, but this meant more global state objects... Plus, I had a fun thought about VelocityAfterImages. With filter we can just add another component check to the filter predicate, but with system specific lists we'd either have to add a second vector (renderable AND velocity), or check each entity for a `:vector-component`, which wouldn't be much better than a filter.

If I need to optimize I can find a memoization technique or something.

Three.js handles rendering for us, so I just need to call `(.render renderer scene camera)`, but Three.js is **heavy** on mutation and low on functional.

Using my ECS component, I was able to separate the Three.js specific updates to meshes in a single function that sets the mesh position from the `:position-component` This made me very happy. If I move from CLJS/WebGL to Clojure/LWJGL, I have less backend specific code to port/abstract, and best of all: less `set!`s being used.

I rushed the input and entity management. Currently the code assumes a single entity, and maps all input to that.

My next steps are to implement entity management and an input component. Entity management should not be difficult, but `input-component` might be... how to best tie it to the input handling code? Maybe `process-input` should ask for components that have an input component (which specifies which input each wants), then populates the command-streams of the entity.

- How best to tie input handler to input consumer?
- Should each entity have a command-stream?
- What to do about entities wanting the same input?
