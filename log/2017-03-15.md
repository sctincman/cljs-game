# Things I Did Today
* Refined the `populate-space` function.
* Added an `intersects?` test for AABB
    * Doesn't return contact points like I want
        * That is something I can add later when I have time to work it out
        * For AABB where this is quick culling, not a mandatory Things
* Added a `collision-pairs` function for AABBs

# Collision Detection Thoughts
I kept fussing over this today... I wanted to get something out quick, but kept overthinking what the most efficient way to do this would be. I think I have too much of the "more accurate" 2D physics engines in my head. [Chipmunk2D](http://chipmunk-physics.net/) was awesome for this, but this is likely overkill for what I initially need. Writing this from scratch may be tedious, and perhaps I should just do a port/rewrite as a separate library.

The `collision-pairs` function doesn't check for duplicate pairs. My thought is for AABB this is cheap enough, and better than a set (worst case: every add checks every other element). I think a recursive solution where an entity can only check on the `rest` of the entities, making it unable to check entities that have already been processed. However, the spatial hash buckets approach I'm using doesn't seem compatible with that--we grab the entities to check from the buckets. This approach would require recursing by passing in `(rest entities)`, as well as a new spatial hash that has the current entity removed. I'm pessimistic about this approach with all that "iterate the entities buckets, `update` and `disj` the id from the list"...

Oh! Wait! The spatial has only stores the ID! If we check the `(rest entities)` map for the ID of an entity we have already tested, it won't be in that map and thus return `nil`. I'll have to change the `intersects?` methods to accept nil as input, and return `false`.

I still need to decide how to actually handle the collisions, but that's tomorrow's problem.
