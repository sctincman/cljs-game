# Things I Did Today
* Cleanup the entities in ECS. Shorter names and no `:components` map (bleh)
* Refactored some of the signals code, moving it to subsystems/namespaces where it made sense
	* Signals are a base communication primitive, systems implement their own behavior using them
    * Keyboard signals moved to input, Frames to render
* Broke out the Camera into an entity, introducing the `:camera` component
	* Backend specific stuff in `[:render :backend]`
    * Changed `[:render :backend :mesh]` to `[:render :backend :object]`. As ThreeJS has "position" in the parent "Object3D" placing anything with position here allows the position to be updated regardless of object type.
    * This is all I was using it for so far. If I need a specific ThreeJS backend object type, I can cast and do ugly ThreeJS stuff there.
    * This leads me to
* Implemented movable camera!
	* Once I had the camera as an entity (and tweaked the ThreeJS backend, grumble), making it movable was as easy as adding `:input` and `:body`!
