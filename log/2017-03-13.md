# Things I did
* Added a spatial hash-map constructor
    * Rough thoughts have me struggling to come up with a more efficient way than constructing from scratch
        * Thus, build one from scratch
* Roughed out prototype for collision solver

# Things to Consider
* How to handle collisions?
    * Signals?
        * Route to pairs
        * General channel/subscribe
            * Default self, can select others
        * Signal in collision shape component
    * Handler?
