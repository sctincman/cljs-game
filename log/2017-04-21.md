# Things I Did Today
* Implemented wrappers around sprites and textures
* Implemented a texture atlas, and based the sprite wrapper around this
    * `defsub/getsub` allow easy access to "subtextures"
    * `key-texture` allows one to easily change a sprite's texture by specifying a key for the subtexture desired
* Decided no use implementing parallax if I have 3D, and verified the effect looks good with perspective camera
* Began adapting the ThreeJS backend to handle creating backend specific render components
    * No more annoying "add-to-backend" calls
* Made `:render` into `:renders` to allow multiple render targets for an entity
    * Updated Cameras to this new system

# Problems to solve

Async texture loading! Ugh!

ThreeJS returns the object immediately, which allows me to store it, but I'm already hitting "can't call on undefined" errors from the object not being populated yet. I need someway to promise this, or not need it's width until much later

I can defer setting the scale until the `prepare-scene`, but that would be more expensive (doing it everyframe, versus when scale changes).

## tiling

Aside from implementing a custom shader, I haven't found a way to do this w/o making a ton of sprites, which reports suggest is horribly slow and memory hog.

...maybe I can offscreen render a new texture and map that to a single large sprite?
