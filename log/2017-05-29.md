# Things I Did
* Prepared a new `create-sprite2` method that uses a `BufferGeometry` and `MeshBasicMaterial` for rendering a "sprite"

# Other stuff
I don't know why I was trying to recreate the `SpritePlugin` using custom shaders and a `BufferGeometry`, when a `MeshBasicMaterial` with the proper parameters was just as good.

The previous approach I was trying would be good in a raw WebGL backend, but required working outside of ThreeJS for the ThreeJS backend. I haven't recovered from the release crunch at work to even think about working on a raw WebGL backend at the moment.

Anyways, with a `BufferGeometry` working, this should be easier to expand into an `InstancedBufferGeometry`! Excited I can finally start thinking of implementing the tiling engine this way.

I don't know what using the `SpritePlugin` is currently getting me. I think I want to rewrite my `ThreeJSSprite` record around this `BufferGeometry`, as it will give greater flexibility in behavior via the materials available.
